# NLW Badge
A simple badge made during a coding event.

# My Journey

This was my first project. **Ever**. It was made during Rocketseat's event, a bootcamp in which I would eventually enroll.

Even though this was my first "real project", I already had some familiarity with HTML, CSS and JS, **thanks to freeCodeCamp and their 12 hour YouTube videos.** With that said, I wouldn't have been able to make this by myself at the time - that's what the event classes were for! üòÅ Good times. 


## Installation

The project is nothing but a badge **(there's a screenshot of it below)**, but in case you feel like cloning the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Maymisk/NLWbadge.git
```


## The badge

The picture on the badge is my GitHub profile picture as of January 29, 2023, **my friend's nape..** I'm changing that.

üò≠ Back in 2021, this was my picture of choice:
